## A  BRIEF OF ALGORITHMS:

#### Target(X): 
  the outcome you aim to predict or explain using your machine learning model.
#### Feature(Y): 
  a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon.
#### fitting:
   a measurement of how well a machine learning model adapts to data that is similar to the data on which it was trained.
#### model:
  a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset.
#### DataSet:
   a collection of data that is used to train and test algorithms and models.
#### Regression:
   a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome.
####  Dimensionality Reduction:
   a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible.
#### Normalization:
  Data normalization is a vital pre-processing, mapping, and scaling method that helps forecasting and prediction models become more accurate. 
#### Supervised And Unsupervised Data:
  Supervised learning uses labeled training data, and unsupervised learning does not. 
#### Classification:
  a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data.
#### Decision Tree:
  Decision tree learning is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.
#### Random Forest:
combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. 
#### clustring:
an unsupervised machine-learning approach that is used to group comparable data points based on specific traits or attributes.
#### support vector machine (SVM):
is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by finding an optimal line or hyperplane that maximizes the distance between each class in an N-dimensional space.
#### Sentimental:
an algorithm is used to train software to gauge sentiment in a block of text using words that appear in the text as well as the order in which they appear.
